# Animals Giphy API

#### In this assignment I have created a Giphy API page that show buttons with the name of animals on it and by clicking on, we are able to send a query to our API and grab the required data to show the response on our page.

#### I have used ajax method to call the GIPHY API and by JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.
